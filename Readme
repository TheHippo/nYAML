nYAML
=====
nYAML is a YAML decoding and encoding library for the nekoVM / haXe.
It is based on yaml-cpp (http://code.google.com/p/yaml-cpp) by
Jesse Beder.

Usage
-----
As a YAML file could contain multiple documents nYAML always
expects Array<Dynamic> as a representation for a whole YAML file.

Decoding:
var file : String = ... read file content ...;
var documents : Array<Dynamic> = nYAML.NYAML.decode(file);

Encoding:
var objects : Array<Dynamic> = [ .... ];
var yaml : String = nYAML.NYAML.encode(objects);
